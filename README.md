### Compatibility

Anki 2.1.20 or higher is required for this add-on to work.

This add-on only works with the Computer version of Anki.
Cards created with this add-on can't be reviewed with the mobile apps or on AnkiWeb.

### Usage

#### Creating / Editing

The note types are automatically added the first time you start Anki after installing the add-on.

When creating cards, write a "1" for correct choices or a "0" for incorrect choices in the "Answers" field.
These values in the "Answer" field must be separated by a single space.
The order and number of values in the "Answer" field must correspond with the choices "MC_1" to "MC_5" (or "MC_4" for "Kprim" cards, respectively).
If you don't need all the choices, just leave the remaining "MC_" fields blank and only enter as many values as you need in the "Answers" field.

#### Reviewing

Select the correct and incorrect choices accordingly and click "Show Answer".
The add-on will automatically style your choices based on whether you answered correctly or not.
